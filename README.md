**CodTech IT Solutions Internship - Task Documentation: To-Do List**

**Intern Information:**  
Name: Nikitha Gundala  
Intern ID: COD6133  

**Introduction:**  
Welcome to the documentation for the To-Do List task as part of the CodTech IT Solutions Internship. In this task, I have created a To-Do List web application using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This documentation aims to provide detailed insights into the implementation of the project, including code explanations and illustrations of the program's execution and user interactions.

**Task Description:**  
The objective of this task is to design and develop a user-friendly To-Do List web application. The application should allow users to add tasks to a list, mark tasks as completed, and delete tasks from the list. Additionally, the interface should be visually appealing and responsive.

**Implementation:**  
**HTML:**  
The HTML file (`index.html`) provides the structure for the To-Do List web application. It includes input fields for adding tasks and a container to display the list of tasks.

**CSS:**  
The CSS file (`style.css`) defines the styles and layout for the web application. It includes styles for the container, input fields, buttons, and task list to ensure a visually appealing and responsive design.

**JavaScript:**  
The JavaScript file (`script.js`) implements the functionality of the To-Do List web application. It handles user interactions such as adding tasks, marking tasks as completed, and deleting tasks from the list. The script ensures a seamless user experience by dynamically updating the task list based on user actions.

**Code Explanation:**  
The JavaScript code listens for a click event on the "Add" button. Upon clicking, it retrieves the task name from the input field, validates it, and creates a new task element dynamically. Each task element contains the task name and a delete button. Users can click on the delete button to remove a task from the list.

**Conclusion:**  
In conclusion, the To-Do List web application successfully fulfills the requirements of the task by providing a user-friendly interface for managing tasks. The project demonstrates proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with the ability to design and develop interactive web applications. This task has provided valuable hands-on experience and enhanced my skills in web development.

This documentation serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding the implementation of the To-Do List project and highlights the key features and functionalities of the application.
